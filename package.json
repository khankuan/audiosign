  "description": "AudioSignJS allows the broadcasting/listening of an id to/from a device to another via sound (Ultrasound). It uses WebAudio to generate a soundwave and loops it continuously while broadcasting. When listening, it uses WebRTC to listen from the mic and WebAudio to process the sound captured. Currently, only 1 device can broadcast at one location at the same time.",
